Check out this [blog post](https://objectpartners.com/2019/05/21/speed-up-spock-spring-tests/) describing the various ways we're testing a Spring application using Spock in this repo.

## Breakdown

Basically, this is a (very contrived) Spring application that I've written 6 different sets of tests for. Each set of tests uses a different strategy, ranging from very complex, thorough tests that validate a lot of Spring behaviors down to very simple tests that focus just on the custom logic.
